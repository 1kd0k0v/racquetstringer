    <!-- Instructions -->
    <string name="instructions_calibration">Every racquet model, string model and stringer have unique characteristics. The “Calibration” completely takes them into account:\n
        1. Take a newly strung racquet.\n
        2. Preset all known racquet and string parameters.\n
        3. Hit the string close to the microphone.\n
        4. “Calibrate” the App by entering the average tension between main and cross strings applied by the stringer.

    <string name="calibration_instructions_body">
        The full capacity of TennisTension can be understood and reached when is used
        with the provided proper Calibration. There are several important factors to
        consider:\n\n
        <li>Tension Loss - starts during stringing and is at very high rate
        during the first couple of hours after stringing and during the first 30
        minutes of play.</li>\n\n
        <li>Type and model of the string with all its characteristics.</li>\n\n
        <li>Stringing machine</li>\n\n
        <li>Stringer abilities and stringing habits</li>\n\nTo make your perfect
        calibration you have to pick a racquet with your string strung by a trusted
        stringer at desired tension couple of hours after stringing. Enter the racquet
        and string parameters in the settings. Tap the string anywhere with anything
        close to the phone microphone. The microphone could be either at the top or at
        the bottom of the phone. After you see that the Factory measurement is done,
        push the Calibrate button and enter the preknown average tension between the
        main and cross strings, which you gave to your trusted stringer in advance.
        Now the Calibration is done,you can see the amendment of the measurements and
        TennisTension is ready for use in a mode with Calibration.

    <string name="instructions_body">
        <li>For best results use the app in places with less noise!</li>\n
        <li>The user has to learn how to produce the proper ringing sound CLOSE (2 to 10 cm) and IN FRONT of the phone microphone. Find the microphone which uses single, very small hole either at the TOP or at the BOTTOM of the phone.</li>\n
        <li>REMOVE the dampener - if you have.</li>\n
        <li>Do not touch the strings with your fingers while measuring.</li>\n
        <li>Tap the racquet strings VERY GENTLY ANYWHERE  several times every 1 or 2 sec. with ANY STIFF object. KEEP the resonating RINGING strings CLOSE (2 to 10 cm) and IN FRONT OF the phone microphone. The best way is with a pen or pencil, or use another racquet, fingernails, etc. It is shown well in the YouTube video https://youtu.be/PNTyjG7jr98 provided for TennisTension mobile app, Google Play Store or on www.tennistension.app</li>\n
        <li>To receive the exact momentous string tension, define all the necessary racquet and string parameters. If you don\'t know some of them, default average values are taken for the calculations or the last values that the user put it in.</li>\n
        <li>TennisTension measures the average tension between main and cross strings of the racquet. For example, if a racquet is strung 25/24 kg, the measurement result will be 24.5 kg.</li>\n
        <li>String tensions of hybrid strings could be measured as well. In this case, define the parameters of both main and cross strings.</li>\n
        <li>The error of the measurement result is less than 0.2 kg when the accurate racquet, string, and stringer/stringing machine parameters are set.</li>\n
        <li>A Calibration for the app is provided in the case you want to cope COMPLETELY and SIMULTANEOUSLY with ALL specific characteristics of your PERSONAL racquet and string model. In this case, use a TRUSTED stringer</li>
